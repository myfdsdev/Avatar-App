/**
 * Inbound vendor callbacks for face training.
 *
 * Vendors are not assumed to sign these, so nothing in the body can
 * be trusted. Two things keep that safe:
 *
 *   - the callback URL carries an HMAC of the job id, so an attacker cannot
 *     address a job they do not already know about;
 *   - the payload is never written. It only prompts a fresh read from the
 *     vendor, so even a perfectly forged call cannot set a status.
 *
 * Always 200. A vendor that gets an error back will retry, and there is
 * nothing useful for it to retry into - by the time we have responded, the
 * reconciliation has already run.
